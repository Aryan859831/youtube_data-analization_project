result 1:data science if started over
result 2:best "free" data science courses "untold"
result 3:"Data science projects for "beginners"
Conclusion : Audiences are looking for fresh ways to learn data science from starting over as "most" are messed up in the "prosess",they are looking for "free ways" to learn and  need "beginner project ideas".
Final Conclusion : These are the 3 biggest intrests of ken Jee's audiences.
